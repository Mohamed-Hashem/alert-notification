          Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This
          example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how
          spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.

          Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things
          nice and tidy.

          Vite aims to provide out-of-the-box support for common web development
          patterns. Before searching for a Vite or compatible Rollup plugin,
          check out{" "}
          <a
            href="https://vite.dev/guide/features.html"
            tabIndex={0}
            aria-label="vite Features Guide"
          >
            The Features Guide
          </a>{" "}
          . A lot of the cases where a plugin would be needed in a Rollup
          project are already covered in Vite.

        <p>
          This pattern does not work if you are using Vite for Server-Side
          Rendering, because <code>import.meta.url</code> have different
          semantics in browsers vs. Node.js. The server bundle also cannot
          determine the client host URL ahead of time.
